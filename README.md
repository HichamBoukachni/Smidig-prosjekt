Important notes 

1. If you only open the homepage and navigate to all the other pages from there, it is a chance that the program can crash. We recommend to atleast open the plugin page on its own from the IDE, that way it is less likely for the program to crash.
2. When you are in the plugins page and click "view results", and nothing happens you will need to go into the "Rapport_Test.py" code and comment out line 8. You have to do the same if you want to open the result page from the home page as well. Or you can download the reportlab in pycharm package manager by following this link: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html#install-in-tool-window
3. If you download this git and the volatility 3 folder is empty, you need to open up this project in a terminal and run this commando: "git submodule update --init --recursive" - If you are in a IDE like Pycharm, you can right click the folder and click "open in" and pick "terminal", you will then be able to do it in the terminal of the IDE.
